# Strategic Welfare Transformation: Closing the Italian Health Protection Gap

## Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven strategic analysis of the Italian health insurance market. It addresses the significant "Protection Gap" where approximately 90% of private healthcare spending remains "Out-of-Pocket" (OOP) rather than being intermediated by insurance. 

Drawing from field experience at a leading Italian insurance agency (Unipol Group), the project combines macroeconomic insights with operational business analysis to design a scalable growth strategy .

## Business Problem
The Italian National Health Service (SSN), a "Beveridge" universalistic model, is currently facing challenges in responsiveness, leading to long waiting lists and a rise in private spending. However, insurance penetration remains low (only ~2% of total health spending), particularly in Southern Italy where coverage drops to approximately 5% compared to 40% in the North-West.

## Strategic Pillars
The project is structured around three main management objectives:
1. **Market Intelligence:** Using SQL and Python to segment regional markets based on OOP spending inefficacy and demographic triggers.
2. **Operational Excellence:** Redesigning the agency funnel to transition front-office staff from a transactional "clerical" mindset to a value-added consultative approach.
3. **Digital Innovation:** Implementing a tech-enabled lead generation system using personalized QR codes to capture customer data and automate lead scoring for specialists.

## Methodology & Tools
- **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for regional segmentation and risk mapping.
- **Database Management:** SQL for lead prioritization and customer database architecture.
- **Business Strategy:** ROI simulations for performance-based incentive programs (tangible rewards vs. cash).

## Key Results (Simulated)
- **Lead Quality:** Identification of the top 20% "High-Potential" leads currently holding only mandatory motor insurance.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Projected 15-20% increase in specialist appointments through digital data capture.
